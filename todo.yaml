TODOs:
  documentation:
    - Add a section guiding through the initial setup
    - Add usage and getting started section
    - Add more example
  code:
    - Add the "file" resolver:
        - FileResolver allow specifying a list of script by path or directory.
        - These script can then be added
    - Move `render*.go` files to internal/service/rendererservice
    - Remove of `urface/cli` -> use
    - Depend on the list amount of packages (hopefully only kubernetes' yamlv3 package)
    - refactor internal/
    - refactor cmd/
    - Refactor APIServer:
        - Must register APIs
        - Must match an APIVersion to a Resolver
    - Refactor Resolvers:
        - Must take some argument and return a response.
        - An API can be constructed from a Resolver
