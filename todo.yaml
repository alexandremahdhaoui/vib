    TODO: Hostname can be an invalid resource name:
          Regex the hostname, if invalid set profile name to default

  documentation:
    - Add a section guiding through the initial setup
    - Add usage and getting started section
    - Add more example

    Validate:
      - TODO: |
          Refactor validation using a hook defined in the APIServer
          -> The registration of an APIVersion should be refactored from
          returning a type.AVKFunc to updating a leaf (by adding the func
          and the hook configuration to the leaf).
          -> Hooks allow non-static configuration.
      - When?:
          - Validation must be performed when a resource is unmarshalled?
          - Or?:
              - by the cli layer: to catch errors early (for user experience)
              - and by the storage layer: to ensure invalid data is never persisted

    Resources:
      - Config: |
          Add the config resource to v1alpha1.
          Config should allow storing namespaces at particular location?

      - ScriptSet: |
          A directory where script can be added to PATH

          It allows users to "apply", "get", "edit", "delete" scripts contained in
          this directory.

      - DocSet: |
          DocSet can be used to set up a new directory containing notes or docs.

          It allows users to "apply", "get", "edit", "delete" docs contained in
          this directory.

      - Namespace: |
          Add the Namespace resource.
          To let users query existing namespaces.
          This may require to create a "_global" non-visible namespace for non-namespaced resources.

          When should a namespace be created?

          One feature of the namespace is that it can be stored on disk at a particular
          location.
          This feature would allow user to source resources from different git repositories.
          E.g.: user can have:
            - a namespace named "private" containing its personal config from a private
              repository
            - a namespace named "team-a" containing the config specific to its team.
          => User can then have a profile containing both its private and team specific config.

          Question: we only have a filesystem storage adapter atm, what if there is another
                    storage type?
                    How is this represented in the config?

    Commands:
      - grep: |
          User can search resources content by regex.

      - get all: |
          User can get all resources of any kind from a namespace.

    CLI:
      - Formatter:
          - Add "-o name" && "-o table" as output format
          - It require refactoring OutputCodec to Formatter

specialResources: |
  Add the following resources:

  Resources:
  - Config: |
  Add the config resource to v1alpha1.
  Config should allow storing namespaces at particular location on the disk. (basically different path)

  - FileSet: |
  FileSet can be used to set up a new directory containing scripts, notes or docs.

  It allows users to "create", "apply", "get", "edit", "delete" scripts, notes or docs contained in this directory.

  A fileset can be considered as a special kind of namespaces because it specifies the path to special resources: custom files.

  FileSets are global resources.

  FileSets holds the "path" field and another field name "customResourceName". If set to "docs", then the user can access these files like if they were resources, except that they are just identified by their name. E.g. they could run "vib get docs mydoc.md". Vib would load all AVKs and also load all known FileSets.CustomResourceName. When a CustomResourceName exist and the user try to get/update... a resource with specified kind equal to the CustomResourceName, then vib loads the FileSet, checks the path and then try to find in that path the file that is named like "mydoc.md" in that directory. There must be special validation to prevent creation and loading of filesets with names that would collide with existing AVKs.
